1)CGPA Calculator (C++)

This project is a CGPA Calculator developed in C++ as part of the CodeAlpha Tasks.

The program calculates a student’s GPA and overall CGPA based on the number of courses, their respective grades, and credit hours. It takes user input for each course, computes total credit hours and total grade points (grade × credit hours), and then accurately calculates the final CGPA. The project demonstrates the use of core C++ concepts such as loops, conditional statements, functions, and basic input/output operations.

Uses: This project helps students easily evaluate their academic performance while showcasing fundamental programming and logical problem-solving skills in C++.

Features:

Input number of courses. Accept grades and credit hours. Calculate GPA and CGPA. Display course-wise results. Simple and user-friendly console interface.

Technologies Used:

C++

Standard Input/Output (iostream)

2)Login and Registration System (C++)

This project is a Login and Registration System developed in C++, designed to simulate a basic user authentication process. The system allows users to register a new account, log in using existing credentials, and validates user input to ensure correct authentication.

User data such as username and password is stored and retrieved using file handling, making the system persistent across multiple runs. The project demonstrates important C++ concepts including file I/O, conditional statements, loops, and basic security logic.

This project helps in understanding how real-world authentication systems work at a basic level while strengthening problem-solving and logical thinking skills in C++.

Features :

User registration with username and password.

Login authentication system.

File handling for storing user credentials.

Input validation.

Console-based user interface.

Technologies Used:

C++

File Handling (fstream)

Standard Input/Output (iostream)
